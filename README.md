# hazard-communication

This repository was created during the Innovate UK [KTN](https://www.ktn-uk.co.uk) event on the communication of uncertainty about hazards sponsored by Dstl.
It was intended to provide a quick example of how using animation to display samples from a distribution (a *hypothetical outcome plot*, or HOP) can help to communicate uncertainty in a value, and aid the comparison of two or more distributions.
